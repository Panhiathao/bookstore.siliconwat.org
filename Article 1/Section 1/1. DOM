 <script>
 <style>
 <meta data>
</head>

<body>
sectioning tags 
 <section>
 <article>
 <p>

 etc
</body>

external, inline or internal 

External is you write in its file
internal is you write in the code in the <script></style>
inline is you style within the code inside the tag

```<style>
			:last-child {
				background: green;
			}
	</style>```
 
 <h style="color:blue" ></h>
